Adapted from Eric Helgeson who has archived his project.

Handy repo/script to compare fresh `create-app` versions of Grails 3 so you can see what changed.

Just compare across tags:
* <https://github.com/sbglasius/grails-versions/compare/3.1.7...3.1.8>
* <https://github.com/sbglasius/grails-versions/compare/3.2.0...3.3.12>
* <https://github.com/sbglasius/grails-versions/compare/3.3.9...4.0.3>
* <https://github.com/sbglasius/grails-versions/compare/4.0.0...4.0.6>
* <https://github.com/sbglasius/grails-versions/compare/4.0.0...4.1.0.M2>

From the git cli:

```bash
git diff 4.0.0..4.0.6
```
